Purpose:
======================================
1: Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2: Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

3: Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4: Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5: From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

==================================================================

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'CodeBook.txt'

- '01_mergedData.csv': merge training dataset, test dataset.

- '01_mergedDataX.csv': merge X_train, X_test.

- '01_mergedDataY.csv': merge Y_train, Y_test.

- '02_extractedData.csv': select measurement on mean & standard deviation for each varaible .

- '03_activityNamedData.csv': add description to activity label.

- '04_datasetFinal.csv': dataset with description to variable & activity.

- '05_summary.csv': tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



Notes: 
======
- Features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].
- Each feature vector is a row on the text file.
